# 3-Phase Corrector and Protector

This project is designed to manage voltage fluctuations and protect devices in 3-phase electrical systems. It offers a solution for ensuring consistent voltage levels, thereby protecting sensitive equipment from power surges, imbalances, and faults.

## Features
- **Voltage Correction**: Stabilizes voltage levels in 3-phase systems.
- **Protection Mechanism**: Safeguards electrical devices from power surges and imbalances.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitors and adjusts voltage in real-time.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing 3-phase systems.

## System Overview
The 3-Phase Corrector and Protector uses a combination of:
- **Microcontroller-based control** for voltage adjustment and protection.
- **Sensor integration** to detect phase imbalances and overvoltage conditions.
- **Relay or contactor control** to disconnect power during fault conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A 3-phase electrical system.
- A compatible microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32).
- Voltage sensors (for monitoring phase voltages).
- Relay or contactor for disconnecting the power.
